# Project-2
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 

This program was to take input from the user and output the amount of interest earned based on the amount of money invested and the interest rate input.  

What did you do particularly well? 

I believe I wrote well defined code and implemented input from the user well. I left enough spaces between lines of code to make my code easy to read and understand. I also added proper in program comments to describe my work for someone that doesn’t understand code. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 

I could have added try and catch coding in to potentially catch any problematic inputs.  

Which pieces of code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 

The code I found the hardest is probably the functions ability. I can write functions well but to get the result from one function into another function is not easy. It took a lot of research and trial and error to get the functions working properly. I used stack overflow the most, asking the correct questions and seeing proper examples was key to my success.  I will constantly be searching google, stack overflow, and GitHub as a strong coding resource. They all have different aspects that are great for learning. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 

All skills I learned in this course will be transferred to future projects and classes. This is supposed to be a basic C++ course but there is so much information being thrown at you without a lot of support. It's kind of like here’s the textbook, read it, learn it, do it. Not the best learning method, especially with all the material crammed into eight weeks. I learned what I could, and the rest will come with practice and patience. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

The program is readable with the amount of in code spacing and comments to show what is being done where. Someone code easily adapt my functions with their own and still be able to compute the program to do what it needs to do.
